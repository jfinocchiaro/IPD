IBRUN: Command is 
Usage:
    ibrun [options] <executable> [executable args]

     Options:
        -n, -np <n>
            launch n MPI ranks (default: use all cores provided by resource manager)

        -o, --offset <n>
            assign MPI ranks starting at the nth slot provided by the resource 
            manager (default: 0)
    
        -no <n>
            assign MPI ranks starting at the nth unique node provided by the 
            resource manager (default: 0)
    
        --npernode <n>
            only launch n MPI ranks per node (default: ppn from resource manager)

        --tpr|--tpp|--threads-per-rank|--threads-per-process <n>
            how many threads each MPI rank (often referred to as 'MPI process') 
            will spawn.  (default: $OMP_NUM_THREADS (if defined), <ppn>/<npernode>
            if ppn is divisible by npernode, or 1 otherwise)
    
        --switches '<implementation-specific switches>'
            Pass additional command-line switches to the underlying implementation's
            MPI launcher.  These WILL be overridden by any switches ibrun 
            subsequently enables (default: none)
    
        -bp|--binding-policy <scatter|compact|none>
            Define the CPU affinity's binding policy for each MPI rank.  'scatter' 
            distributes ranks across each binding level, 'compact' fills up a 
            binding level before allocating another, and 'none' disables all 
            affinity settings (default: optimized for job geometry)
    
        -bl|--binding-level <core|socket|numanode|none>
            Define the level of granularity for CPU affinity for each MPI rank.  
            'core' binds each rank to a single core; 'socket' binds each rank to 
            all cores on a single CPU socket (good for multithreaded ranks); 
            'numanode' binds each rank to the subset of cores belonging to a
            numanode; 'none' disables all affinity settings. (default: optimized 
            for job geometry)

        --dryrun
            Do everything except actually launch the application

        -v|--verbose
